/// A type representing an owned, C-compatible, UTF-8, nul-terminated string with no nul bytes in the
/// middle.
/// This type is `#[repr(transparent)]` and can be transmuted to a <code>&[`CString`]</code> safely.
///
/// This type serves the purpose of being able to safely generate a
/// C-compatible string from a Rust string. An instance of this
/// type is a static guarantee that the underlying bytes contain no interior 0
/// bytes ("nul characters") and that the final byte is 0 ("nul terminator").
///
/// `Utf8CString` is to <code>&[`Utf8CStr`]</code> as [`String`] is to <code>&[str]</code>: the former
/// in each pair are owned strings; the latter are borrowed
/// references.
///
/// # Creating a `Utf8CString`
///
/// A `Utf8CString` is created from either a borrowed or owned string,
/// or anything that implements <code>[Into]<[String]></code> (for
/// example, you can build a `Utf8CString` straight out of a [`String`] or
/// a <code>&[str]</code>, since both implement that trait).
///
/// The [`Utf8CString::new`] method will actually check that the provided string
/// does not have 0 bytes in the middle, and return an error if it
/// finds one.
///
/// # Extracting a raw pointer to the whole C string
///
/// `Utf8CString` implements an [`as_ptr`][`Utf8CStr::as_ptr`] method through the [`Deref`]
/// trait. This method will give you a `*const c_char` which you can
/// feed directly to extern functions that expect a nul-terminated
/// string, like C's `strdup()`. Notice that [`as_ptr`][`Utf8CStr::as_ptr`] returns a
/// read-only pointer; if the C code writes to it, that causes
/// undefined behavior.
///
/// # Extracting a slice of the whole C string
///
/// Alternatively, you can obtain a <code>&[[u8]]</code> slice from a
/// `CString` with the [`Utf8CStr::as_bytes`] method. Slices produced in this
/// way do *not* contain the trailing nul terminator. This is useful
/// when you will be calling an extern function that takes a `*const
/// u8` argument which is not necessarily nul-terminated, plus another
/// argument with the length of the string â€” like C's `strndup()`.
/// You can of course get the slice's length with its
/// [`len`][slice::len] method.
///
/// If you need a <code>&[[u8]]</code> slice *with* the nul terminator, you
/// can use [`Utf8CStr::as_bytes_with_nul`] instead.
///
/// Once you have the kind of slice you need (with or without a nul
/// terminator), you can call the slice's own
/// [`as_ptr`][slice::as_ptr] method to get a read-only raw pointer to pass to
/// extern functions. See the documentation for that function for a
/// discussion on ensuring the lifetime of the raw pointer.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// `Utf8CString` is intended for working with traditional C-style strings
/// (a sequence of non-nul bytes terminated by a single nul byte); the
/// primary use case for these kinds of strings is interoperating with C-like
/// code. Often you will need to transfer ownership to/from that external
/// code. It is strongly recommended that you thoroughly read through the
/// documentation of `Utf8CString` before use, as improper ownership management
/// of `Utf8CString` instances can lead to invalid memory accesses, memory leaks,
/// and other memory errors.
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// **Most conversions ([`AsRef`], [`Deref`], etc) exclude the nul terminator.**
///
/// If you want to get a string *with* the nul terminator, you will need to use the `as_*_with_nul` methods.
